		08 Thursday
			- Included Event.h/cpp
			 -- An abstract class that allows users to implement their own events through it's Run function.
			- Included EventCatalog
			 -- This class is now what "registers" and looks up user events.
			- GlobalVariables.h/cpp
			 -- Included DESE namespace
			 -- Removed lots of VarGet_TYPE functions, replaced them for a template function
			 -- Removed all catch (out_of_range) checks and almost all catch (bad_cast). Functions had parameters DefaultNotFound and DefaultBadCast and behaved as "C style" functions, with specific returns in case of errors.
			 -- Now exceptions WON'T be handled and will be allowed to propagate through code.
